			The goal of G2S is to offer a high-accuracy, high-reliable,
			auto-updating computational services providing protein sequence to
			tertiary structure alignments in residue level. The workflow and
			architecture of G2S is shown as the following Figure. Solid lines are
			in <b>Initiate</b> workflow, dash lines are in <b>Update</b>
			workflow.

		<h4>
			<b>Figure 1</b>: Initiate/Update Workflow and Architecture of G2S Web Service
		</h4>
		<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:1.2em">
			To initiate the G2S web service, manually reviewed Uniprot
			(Swiss-Prot) sequences are integrated with Isoform sequences in
			recent release (2016_11) of UniProt (www.uniprot.org ), all sequences
			without isoforms are assigned as isoform 1. Then recent release of
			protein sequences from Human Release 87 in Ensembl (www.ensembl.org )
			are integrated into UniProt sequences identified by the sequences.
			All identical sequences are combined together to remove redundancy. A
			strict threshold as 100% Redundancy is defined on the protein
			sequences, so only non-identical sequences will be left as an
			individual entry. Then these sequences are reorganized in internal
			SequenceId as the <b>Query Sequences</b>. The Target Sequences are
			elaborately parsing from ATOM records in PDB files from all solved
			protein tertiary structures in the whole PDB by BioJava
			(www.biojava.org ). Because of the uneven quality of PDB and
			technology limitations, chains of proteins often isolated by disorder
			regions failed to get structure solved. The solved pieces are
			re-sorted ascendingly and only the residues of the first biological
			assembly are chosen as the residue indices. To avoid too many small
			fragments, artificial repeat residues “X”s as Linker is used to
			connect these isolated pieces to keep continuity. Linked pieces
			failed to link with other pieces in a chain are defined as Segments.
			So segments in individual chain are organized as the basic unit of <b>Target
				Sequences</b>. In any Target Sequence, each residue in continuity has
			associated tertiary structure information comes from PDB. In G2S, the
			minimum length of Segment is set as 10, and the maximum Linker length
			is set as 5.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:1.2em">
			Once both Query and Target sequences are established, the Query
			Sequences are aligned with Target Sequences by BLASTP with predefined
			parameters. To avoid unnecessary non-informational results, each
			Query Sequence has maximum 50 alignments from Target Sequences sorted
			by Evalue. These alignment results are parsed and stored in a
			database. G2S API are implemented to obtain these pre-calculated
			alignments via querying this database by UniProt/Ensembl names for
			UniProt/Ensembl queries. Ensembl REST API is invoked to retrieve
			Ensembl names for the genomic region on Human Genome Version GRCH37.
			Besides adopt established protein names by the G2S API, any
			user-defined protein sequences could also be accepted and calculated
			in real time by the Sequence Web Interface. These input sequences
			will be aligned against up-to-date Target Sequences parsing form PDB
			files by BLASTP with user-defined parameters.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:1.2em">
			G2S has the capability of <b>auto-updating</b> of alignments from
			updating protein sequences against updating PDB. When PDB archive
			updates every Wednesday, the alignments of the obsolete and modified
			structures are abandoned, and only alignments between Query Sequences
			against new and modified structures in the PDB updates are inserted
			to the database. Meanwhile, these updates will be merged into Target
			Sequences. This update process is scheduled every week automatically
			to keep the database up to date with the PDB archive. When new
			version of UniProt and Ensembl released, the workflow will
			re-initiate and all Query Sequences will be regenerated, then the
			whole database will be replaced with new alignments between the Query
			Sequences and Target Sequences.
